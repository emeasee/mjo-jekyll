In the process of conducting my initial desk/literary research I have set up a tumblelog to capture a bit of a visual focus for the area that I&#39;m looking at for my thesis.</p><p>For now it&#39;s simply, &quot;Ongoing research into the meaning of nature in an increasingly urbanised world&quot;.</p><p>We&#39;ll see where it goes from there! Click the screengrab or over <a href="http://metronature.tumblr.com/">here</a> if you prefer the classic way.</p><p><a href="http://metronature.tumblr.com/"><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20shot%202011%2010%2016%20at%2002%2022%2045%201.png alt=metro></span></a></p></article><article class=timeline><p>Today I took a trip to the coast or Copenhagen (Amager Strand) to have a look around the allotments there. I had been tipped off about it by some friends at <a href="http://www.ciid.dk/">CIID</a> and thought it a good opportunity to kick off some immersion and see if I could make some contacts for any future co-design/user validation.</p><p><img src="http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/allotments/IMG_6442 1.jpg" alt="IMG 8564" title=IMG_8564.jpg></p><p><img src="http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/allotments/IMG_6444 1.jpg" alt="IMG 8564" title=IMG_8564.jpg></p><p><img src="http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/allotments/IMG_6445 1.jpg" alt="IMG 8564" title=IMG_8564.jpg></p><p><img src="http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/allotments/IMG_6449 1.jpg" alt="IMG 8564" title=IMG_8564.jpg></p><p>Approaching the allotments early in the morning the place was fairly quite with not too many people around. Plots had land on which people were growing an assortment of vegetables and ornamentals as well as a small shed in which they, presumably kept tools and materials for the growing season. It was visibly obvious that it was the end of the season. Some plots were withering away while others had a bit more care put in to keep them going well into the winter season (greenhouses and such).</p><p><strong>Yet in general there was a wilderness about the place.</strong></p><p>It&#39;s something I notice more and more in Denmark especially that gardeners appreciate the natural order by which their gardens/plots grow. Only exerting minimal control in ordering what grows next to what and where. As well, of course, making sure they don&#39;t invade neighbour gardens! There was also a plethora of <strong>homemade constructions for greenhouses, trellises, potting</strong> etc. It seems there is a joy in both growing but also facilitating that growth but constructing their own rigs and beddings rather than buying flat pack as it were.</p><p>A solitary woman managed to jump out at me from her shed and say a hello upon which I started to ask her about her garden and the more formal procedures of obtaining a space in the collective. It&#39;s been a very busy season it seams with a long waiting list for next year. And I can understand why. Almost immediately she tells me this she was showing me her rhubarb and boasting at it&#39;s size this year. <strong>The people here are obviously proud and I&#39;m left with the feeling, as I bid her farewell, that maybe there isn&#39;t much that should be done here to change any of that.</strong></p><p>Some interesting questions which I will take into my visit tomorrow with <a href="http://www.aarstiderne.com/">Aarstiderne</a>.</p></article><article class=timeline><p>After yesterday&#39;s visit to the allotments I was jumped at the opportunity to visit the Main Farm/Offices of food-box delivery service, <a href=http://www.aarstiderne.com>Aarstriderne</a>. The company has made a name for itself in Denmark through it&#39;s effective delivery of fresh, organic, locally grown produce to the citizens of Copenhagen. From this, and two much larger farms outside of city, the business delivers to approx. 40,000 households throughout Denmark.</p><p><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/aarstiderne/IMG_6461%201.jpg alt=aarstiderne><i>The front entrance of the Aarstiderne farm tucked away in the Danish country side.</i></p><p>The numbers are impressive and business is obviously doing very well, but I was more interested in specifically what the business was doing in fostering knowledge and interest in organic, homegrown produce. To my surprise I had arrived on a day where the Head Farm had turned into a giant activity area for three local schools who had come down to learn about growing, cooking and tending to the daily duties of the farm. A fine coincidence! The aim was to encourage social learning and appreciation for nature beyond the walls of classroom. Kids were encouraged to plant, tend and take care of their own bit of farm over the course of a season and at the end the produce was cooked into a multitude of delicious smelling dishes.</p><p><img src="http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/aarstiderne/IMG_6467 1.jpg" alt="IMG 8564" title=IMG_8564.jpg></p><p><img src="http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/aarstiderne/IMG_6470 1.jpg" alt="IMG 8564" title=IMG_8564.jpg></p><p><img src="http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/aarstiderne/IMG_6471 1.jpg" alt="IMG 8564" title=IMG_8564.jpg></p><p>Among many things I learned from this visit, I want to just touch on this one key insight. The business promotes this initiative and organises it separately from it&#39;s core business of delivery boxes; but maybe there is an opportunity here to provide the same knowledge and inspiration (as seen with the children on the farm) through the channel of communication they already have with many people in the city of Copenhagen itself.</p><p><img src="http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/aarstiderne/IMG_6480 1.jpg" alt="IMG 8564" title=IMG_8564.jpg></p><p>There are many more insights but time is short and I need to get working on my design proposal! Check in for the weeknotes tomorrow for more on my thinking so far!</p></article><article class=timeline><p>After a heavy beginning of the week in involving a lot of sense making and meetings with advisors and fellow students we all managed to organise ourselves for 2 days of intense group brainstorming. It was a fun few days with some great ideas coming out. Leading up to a break we are having in the process to do another industry project, I will be clustering and developing a rough &quot;roadmap&quot; for how to proceed with prototyping. Looking forward to making stuff!</p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/stormythesis/IMG_6499%201.jpg alt=brainstorm></span></p></article><article class=timeline><p>The latter part of this week was spent mostly pulling together my research, initial ideas and concepts from multiple brainstorming sessions and the final result is my design proposal below. It&#39;s not deep by any means but I feel it is a good enough point to start exploring with prototypes proceeding week four (I&#39;m currently finalising plans for prototyping in Paris!).</p><p>My main focus for this project, as is explained below in the diagram, is to first create a service of convenience and then on the back of that foundation attempt to develop a project which starts to push towards the second circle to the left and ultimately answering the question mark in the middle. It&#39;s funny to think of my project as a question mark after all these last few weeks research and investigation but I really believe that question mark has such great value and opportunity embedded in it.</p><p><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/proposal-01.jpeg alt="Proposal 01" title=proposal-01.jpg></p><p><strong>So what, exactly, is my design challenge?</strong></p><p>To create a product-service that helps busy, urban citizens who have the desire to eat healthily, get started with landless gardening in their own flats/apartments. This would exist within the context of, first, a convenient subscription service delivering fresh, still-growing herbs to the customersâ€™ door. Then using this channel of communication between consumer and service I want to explore how, consequently, I can help consumers maintain a garden themselves by progressively connecting them to the right knowledge about how to care for it and eventually to other gardeners/customers for inspiration and support.</p><p>My ultimate goal would be to provide a product/service intervention that would be progressive, convenient and modular and would exist as platform upon which customers can help and inform each other, co-create new products themselves and help to promote a sustainable way of living.</p><p><em>To create a product-service that helps busy, urban citizens who have the desire to eat healthily, get started with landless gardening in their own flats/apartments.</em></p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>The popularity of such services as Aarstiderne in Denmark and others worldwide have shown a opportunity to inspire people to eat healthily by providing a convenient service which takes a lot of the effort out of doing so. However, inspiring people to grow something themselves still remains an area of opportunity.</p><p><strong>How can I create a smarter relationship between individual customers and the service by encouraging them to learn how to grow their own through knowledge exchange and experimentation?</strong></p><p>Providing a system that starts small and allows the consumer to scale up in a convenient way to the point where growing something feels comfortable and even enjoyable.</p><p><strong>How can I create a scalable system for apartment gardening by making it convenient and informative?</strong></p><p>Waiting lists have become the bane of any beginner gardener in the city. Allotments and urban gardening initiatives are struggling to keep up with demand. A clear indicator that people want to get involved in gardening and all for different reasons.</p><p><strong>How can I include those who already garden into the service to encourage people in the city to explore growing in their own homes?</strong></p><p>To respond to increasing urban population and urban density.</p><p><strong>How can I leverage increased population density to inspire sharing of knowledge and produce by opening channels of communications between customers?</strong></p><p>Increase social engagement between neighbours, communities, the service and other customers/gardeners.</p><p><strong>How can I create a user group culture to inspire customers to learn and create together by simply delivering a system with increasing potential the more involved a customer gets?</strong></p></article><article class=timeline><p>While in Paris I was lucky enough to hold a brief co-creation session with a few people in and around Paris. The activity was simple. Make your own seeding box for use indoors. (Winter is coming in!) My initial aim was to provide as little guidance as possible and let the others build it as they want. Everyone learnt a lot, including myself. Gave me many insights and opportunities. Keep tuned for the first design prototypes.</p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/co-creating_herbbox/IMG_7655%201.jpg alt=cocreate1></span></p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/co-creating_herbbox/IMG_7669%201.jpg alt=cocreate2></span></p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/co-creating_herbbox/IMG_7672%201.jpg alt=cocreate3></span></p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/co-creating_herbbox/IMG_7676%201.jpg alt=cocreate4></span></p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/co-creating_herbbox/IMG_7678%201.jpg alt=cocreate5></span></p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/co-creating_herbbox/IMG_7702%201.jpg alt=cocreate1></span></p></article><article class=timeline><p>Just finished the prototyping plan for this week and next. Six prototypes planned in all, each one slightly different from another but all using the service I&#39;ve mentioned before as a core. The box will (hopefully) focus the prototypes a bit and help me get them done in such a such a short space of time so as to not get stuck in trying to design the perfect box!</p><p>As a bit of insight into my process below is a bit of scattered visualisation of my process from the research summary drawn up for brainstorming and through to my first design themes.</p><p><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/process_map-01.jpeg alt=process></p><p>From my design themes I&#39;ve laid out the six prototypes corresponding to each theme. Two prototypes for each theme exploring the concepts from the amazing brainstorming session I had here with fellow CIID&#39;ers. Each prototype asks the questions posed by some of the concepts in a physical way so that I can get as much engagement in the experience prototyping sessions a possible.</p><p>The prototypes are:</p><h3>Smarter Service Relationship</h3><p>Prototype 01a - Home delivery herbs<br>A plant box for your home that delivers information</p><p>Activity:<br>Set up a &quot;herb-box&quot; (like a post box) outside flat/house and over time deliver fresh herbs.</p><p>Prototype 01b - Communal/Family activity<br>A plant box for your home that encourages information sharing in a local environment (family/communal living)</p><p>Activity:<br>A fresh box of herbs with labels on what the herbs are.<br>All the labels are blank and the participants need to fill in what information they would like to store there if it existed in the kitchen.</p><h3>Learning Together</h3><p>Prototype 02a - Sharing knowledge<br>Encouraging remote sharing of knowledge by leveraging the services existing communication channel</p><p>Activity:<br>A delivered herb box has a book where you can write or attach notes. The activity is to think of something you would write there to someone who may receive the same box in the future.</p><p>Prototype 02b - Physical connection<br>Encouraging physical sharing of knowledge and produce in a local community area (block of flats/neighbourhood)</p><p>Activity:<br>A communal box in the hall of a block flats that has take away cards with recipes and herbs. Front is the recipe and fold out are invitation tokens to people for dinner.</p><h3>Co-creation Culture</h3><p>Prototype 03a - Modularity<br>A base (herb box) that allows extension to allow urban gardening at home. Encouraging great range of freedom in creating a growing system from the herb box.</p><p>Activity:<br>A herb box comes with fold out paper &quot;limbs&quot; that suggest extension for extra growing space, watering system, embedded seeds, etc.<br>TBC - QR codes attached to the &quot;limbs&quot; of the box allows you to see blueprints of extendability using everyday items around the house</p><p>Prototype 03b - Networking<br>&quot;Making plants talk&quot;. Physically effecting each others gardens/plants to teach &amp; inform.</p><p>Activity:<br>A box with LEDS that indicate when the &quot;master gardener&quot; is caring for the plant so you can join in. (LEDS specific to watering for now). + sticker that makes it clear what it&#39;s about and it&#39;s not just a light.</p><p>Let&#39;s get making!</p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/IMG_7818.jpeg alt=process></span></p></article><article class=timeline><p>Quick update with some images of how the first prototypes are progressing.</p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/thesismaking1/IMG_7799%201.jpg alt=making1></span></p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/thesismaking1/IMG_7801%201.jpg alt=making2></span></p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/thesismaking1/IMG_7803%201.jpg alt=making3></span></p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/thesismaking1/IMG_7806%201.jpg alt=making4></span></p><p><span><img src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/thesismaking1/IMG_7818%201.jpg alt=making5></span></p><p>Next week: modularity &amp; Arduino.

Time to catch up!</p><p>I was lucky enough to take back another batch of rapid idea prototypes to some of the people around Copenhagen I&#39;ve been researching &amp; co-creating with over past few weeks.</p><p>This time my concepts focused a bit more in the, if it&#39;s fair to say, &quot;digital realm&quot;. The decision to tailor my prototypes more towards this was based on two things. Firstly, and unashamedly, I&#39;ve grown an interest in developing a solution for urban gardening exploring it&#39;s relationship with current advances in technology, sensing and social networking. It&#39;s a like a personal inquiry. Can technology and growing something integrate better than they currently do? Secondly, a lot of the feedback I was getting from people using some of the early prototypes were highlighting inconsistencies in the way the product (or service) was conveyed through the form of an idea prototype and the reality of the solution to their everyday lives. something became clear. &quot;Smart&quot; stuff is everywhere now. Including that particular gem, the smartphone.</p><p><img alt="" src=http://m-jo.s3.amazonaws.com/IMG_8177.jpeg></p><p>I decided to incorporate some of these realities in an attempt to suggest ways that &quot;smart&quot; technology can not only be &quot;smart&quot; itself but also let YOU be smart. In essence that is what my project is trying to do, using growing as a context.</p><p>For now I won&#39;t go into the exact details of how they work or what they are, suffice to say that to the right we have a service/product to help and inspire people to care for their herbs or plants by providing feedback in a specific tone of voice (I will release a video soon to explain more). To the left we have a&quot;seed starter kit&quot;. Simple and similar to many on the market except this one encourages you to keep in contact with your seedling through email. A strange combination I know. Strange enough for user testing? Yes!</p><blockquote><p>No that&#39;s really odd I would prefer the other one where it shows me on the actual box. I feel attach then. Like it&#39;s my box. And it&#39;s helping me out.</p></blockquote><p>An important point was bought up at this point. People, you and me and everyday folk, develop interest in something progressively and often because of incentive. It&#39;s why it&#39;s so common for people who eat healthy to often find themselves caring for herbs. Some even find themselves trying to sprout their own herbs at this point. But the important point raised is that it&#39;s progressive. Pushing a seed box onto the market without a real grounding in something that encourages, excites and delights people to care for something like a plant in the first place has an obvious outcome.</p><p>A main thing I learned again from doing this testing was a dual stroke. People want help in understanding the potential and problems of THEIR environment when it comes to growing and caring for a plant. If they don&#39;t they can&#39;t care. If they can&#39;t care, they lose interest and give up. I think I describe everyone&#39;s experience of buying a potted herb from a supermarket only to find it dead 2 days later.</p><blockquote><p>And I give it sun, and water but nothing. It died. I actually kept the bonsai tree. Maybe because I still want to know why it died...?</p></blockquote></article><article class=timeline><p>An update from the shop floor. I&#39;m heavily back into making the final prototype in preparation for testing over the weekend so this will just be a quick one.
