Hopefully I&#8217;ll get this finished off by the end of next week, but here&#8217;s a bit of summary of my learnings, core interests and most important of all; PLANNING!</p></article><article class=timeline><p>After a heavy beginning of the week in involving a lot of sense making and meetings with advisors and fellow students we all managed to organise ourselves for 2 days of intense group brainstorming. It was a fun few days with some great ideas coming out. Leading up to a break we are having in the process to do another industry project, I will be clustering and developing a rough &#8216;roadmap&#8217; for how to proceed with prototyping. Looking forward to making stuff!</p></article><article class=timeline><p>The latter part of this week was spent mostly pulling together my research, initial ideas and concepts from multiple brainstorming sessions and the final result is my design proposal below. It&#8217;s not deep by any means but I feel it is a good enough point to start exploring with prototypes proceeding week four (I&#8217;m currently finalising plans for prototyping in Paris!).</p><p>My main focus for this project, as is explained below in the diagram, is to first create a service of convenience and then on the back of that foundation attempt to develop a project which starts to push towards the second circle to the left and ultimately answering the question mark in the middle. It&#8217;s funny to think of my project as a question mark after all these last few weeks research and investigation but I really believe that question mark has such great value and opportunity embedded in it.</p><p><img src=/attach/proposal-01.jpeg alt="Proposal 01" title=proposal-01.jpg border=0 width=600 height=423> <span style=text-decoration:underline>So what, exactly, is my design challenge?<br></span></p><p>To create a product-service that helps busy, urban citizens who have the desire to eat healthily, get started with landless gardening in their own flats/apartments. This would exist within the context of, first, a convenient subscription service delivering fresh, still-growing herbs to the customersâ€™ door. Then using this channel of communication between consumer and service I want to explore how, consequently, I can help consumers maintain a garden themselves by progressively connecting them to the right knowledge about how to care for it and eventually to other gardeners/customers for inspiration and support.</p><p>My ultimate goal would be to provide a product/service intervention that would be progressive, convenient and modular and would exist as platform upon which customers can help and inform each other, co-create new products themselves and help to promote a sustainable way of living.</p><p><span style=text-decoration:underline>Why?<br></span></p><ol><li><em>The popularity of such services as Aarstiderne in Denmark and others worldwide have shown a opportunity to inspire people to eat healthily by providing a convenient service which takes a lot of the effort out of doing so. However, inspiring people to grow something themselves still remains an area of opportunity.</em></li></ol><p>How can I create a smarter relationship between individual customers and the service by encouraging them to learn how to grow their own through knowledge exchange and experimentation?</p><ol><li><em>Providing a system that starts small and allows the consumer to scale up in a convenient way to the point where growing something feels comfortable and even enjoyable.</em></li></ol><p>How can I create a scalable system for apartment gardening by making it convenient and informative?</p><ol><li><em>Waiting lists have become the bane of any beginner gardener in the city. Allotments and urban gardening initiatives are struggling to keep up with demand. A clear indicator that people want to get involved in gardening and all for different reasons.</em></li></ol><p>How can I include those who already garden into the service to encourage people in the city to explore growing in their own homes?</p><ol><li><em>To respond to increasing urban population and urban density.</em></li></ol><p>How can I leverage increased population density to inspire sharing of knowledge and produce by opening channels of communications between customers?</p><ol><li><em>Increase social engagement between neighbours, communities, the service and other customers/gardeners.</em></li></ol><p>How can I create a user group culture to inspire customers to learn and create together by simply delivering a system with increasing potential the more involved a customer gets?</p></article><article class=timeline><p>I just got back from my trip to Paris for a bit of mix between celebrating my birthday and looking out for opportunities and inspiration for my thesis project. What a breath of fresh air! It was wonderful to see an existing cultural importance put on having small plants and &#8216;pockets of nature&#8217; in the limited space of the Parisian urban environment. A lot of the classic Parisian balconies were adorned with mini-garden and upon further investigation it became clear that there were many different reasons for this. Some were focused on growing their garden&#8217;s more naturally while others were more for showing off their plants and balcony boxes as a way of showing homeliness and care. Of course it all fitted perfectly into the fabric of the city and is by now an endearing memory for many tourists and residents. Especially me!</p></article><article class=timeline><p>While in Paris I was lucky enough to hold a brief co-creation session with a few people in and around Paris. The activity was simple. Make your own seeding box for use indoors. (Winter is coming in!) My initial aim was to provide as little guidance as possible and let the others build it as they want. Everyone learnt a lot, including myself. Gave me many insights and opportunities. Keep tuned for the first design prototypes.</p><p>Above is a quick photo-essay of one that turned out quite nice!</p></article><article class=timeline><p>Just finished the prototyping plan for this week and next. Six prototypes planned in all, each one slightly different from another but all using the service I&#8217;ve mentioned before as a core. The box will (hopefully) focus the prototypes a bit and help me get them done in such a such a short space of time so as to not get stuck in trying to design the perfect box!</p><p>As a bit of insight into my process below is a bit of scattered visualisation of my process from the research summary drawn up for brainstorming and through to my first design themes.</p><p><a href=/attach/process_map-01.jpeg><img src=/attach/process_map-01-1.jpeg alt="" title="process_map-01 1" width=600 height=848 class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2238"></a> From my design themes I&#8217;ve laid out the six prototypes corresponding to each theme. Two prototypes for each theme exploring the concepts from the amazing brainstorming session I had here with fellow CIID&#8217;ers. Each prototype asks the questions posed by some of the concepts in a physical way so that I can get as much engagement in the experience prototyping sessions a possible.</p><p>The prototypes are:</p><h3>Smarter Service Relationship</h3><p>Prototype 01a &#8211; Home delivery herbs<br>*A plant box for your home that delivers information *</p><p>Activity:<br>Set up a &#8216;herb-box&#8217; (like a post box) outside flat/house and over time deliver fresh herbs.</p><p>Prototype 01b &#8211; Communal/Family activity<br><em>A plant box for your home that encourages information sharing in a local environment (family/communal living)</em></p><p>Activity:<br>A fresh box of herbs with labels on what the herbs are.<br>All the labels are blank and the participants need to fill in what information they would like to store there if it existed in the kitchen.</p><h3>Learning Together</h3><p>Prototype 02a &#8211; Sharing knowledge<br><em>Encouraging remote sharing of knowledge by leveraging the services existing communication channel</em></p><p>Activity:<br>A delivered herb box has a book where you can write or attach notes. The activity is to think of something you would write there to someone who may receive the same box in the future.</p><p>Prototype 02b &#8211; Physical connection<br><em>Encouraging physical sharing of knowledge and produce in a local community area (block of flats/neighbourhood)</em></p><p>Activity:<br>A communal box in the hall of a block flats that has take away cards with recipes and herbs. Front is the recipe and fold out are invitation tokens to people for dinner.</p><h3>Co-creation Culture</h3><p>Prototype 03a &#8211; Modularity<br>*A base (herb box) that allows extension to allow urban gardening at home. Encouraging great range of freedom in creating a growing system from the herb box. *</p><p>Activity:<br>A herb box comes with fold out paper &#8216;limbs&#8217; that suggest extension for extra growing space, watering system, embedded seeds, etc.<br>TBC &#8211; QR codes attached to the &#8220;limbs&#8221; of the box allows you to see blueprints of extendability using everyday items around the house</p><p>Prototype 03b &#8211; Networking<br><em>&#8216;Making plants talk&#8217;. Physically effecting each others gardens/plants to teach &amp; inform.</em></p><p>Activity:<br>A box with LEDS that indicate when the &#8216;master gardener&#8217; is caring for the plant so you can join in. (LEDS specific to watering for now). + sticker that makes it clear what it&#8217;s about and it&#8217;s not just a light.</p><p>Let&#8217;s get making!</p><p><img src=/attach/IMG_7818.jpeg alt="IMG 7818" title=IMG_7818.jpg border=0 width=600 height=400></p></article><article class=timeline><p>Quick update with some images of how the first prototypes are progressing.</p><p>Next week: modularity &amp; Arduino. Looking forward!</p></article><article class=timeline><p>Never in my life have I had hot glue burns and brown fingers from soil until this project!</p><p>An update from the workshop here at CIID. I&#8217;m currently putting the finishing touches on the first round of prototypes. I have an experience prototyping session arranged for Saturday morning and so I have decided to postpone my usual weeknotes until Saturday/Sunday evening to make full use of the session. (And have something more to write about other than how hard it is to laser cut Coca-Cola bottle caps&#8230; ask me about it sometime!).</p></article><article class=timeline><p>Thought I&#8217;d throw up a quick slideshow of last weeks user testing. I must say it was very useful and I look forward to developing the concept further. More details are coming in the form of my late weeknotes! Look out for that soon.</p></article><article class=timeline><p>The weekends&#8217; efforts. I&#8217;m definitely focusing in on something more and more as I busy myself in the design phase. It&#8217; s one of my favourite times of a project when working through a problem with your hands and sketching you can really start to tighten up was has been a lot of open ended questions up until now. Most are just experiments and a way for me to think. More coming soon!</p></article><article class=timeline><p>Here&#8217;s a short video I shot and edited in a day to describe the vision behind my design direction currently.</p><p>Apologies for both the overly dramatic music and &#8216;did-it-while-cooking&#8217; AE motion tracking&#8230;</p><p>Enjoy!</p></article><article class=timeline><p><img alt="" src=/attach/IMG_8175.jpeg class=alignleft width=600 height=400> A belated update indeed. Time to catch up!</p><p>I was lucky enough to take back another batch of rapid idea prototypes to some of the people around Copenhagen I&#8217;ve been researching &amp; co-creating with over past few weeks.</p><p>This time my concepts focused a bit more in the, if it&#8217;s fair to say, &#8220;digital realm&#8221;. The decision to tailor my prototypes more towards this was based on two things. Firstly, and unashamedly, I&#8217;ve grown an interest in developing a solution for urban gardening exploring it&#8217;s relationship with current advances in technology, sensing and social networking. It&#8217;s a like a personal inquiry. Can technology and growing something integrate better than they currently do? Secondly, a lot of the feedback I was getting from people using some of the early prototypes were highlighting inconsistencies in the way the product (or service) was conveyed through the form of an idea prototype and the reality of the solution to their everyday lives. something became clear. &#8216;Smart&#8217; stuff is everywhere now. Including that particular gem, the smartphone.</p><p>I decided to incorporate some of these realities in an attempt to suggest ways that &#8216;smart&#8217; technology can not only be &#8216;smart&#8217; itself but also let YOU be smart. In essence that is what my project is trying to do, using growing as a context.</p><p>Here&#8217;s some examples.</p><p><img alt="" src=/attach/IMG_8177.jpeg class=alignleft width=600 height=400> For now I won&#8217;t go into the exact details of how they work or what they are, suffice to say that to the right we have a service/product to help and inspire people to care for their herbs or plants by providing feedback in a specific tone of voice (I will release a video soon to explain more). To the left we have a &#8216;seed starter kit&#8217;. Simple and similar to many on the market except this one encourages you to keep in contact with your seedling through email. A strange combination I know. Strange enough for user testing? Yes!</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;No that&#8217;s really odd I would prefer the other one where it shows me on the actual box. I feel attach then. Like it&#8217;s my box. And it&#8217;s helping me out&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>An important point was bought up at this point. People, you and me and everyday folk, develop interest in something progressively and often because of incentive. It&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so common for people who eat healthy to often find themselves caring for herbs. Some even find themselves trying to sprout their own herbs at this point. But the important point raised is that it&#8217;s progressive. Pushing a seed box onto the market without a real grounding in something that encourages, excites and delights people to care for something like a plant in the first place has an obvious outcome.</p><p>A main thing I learned again from doing this testing was a dual stroke. People want help in understanding the potential and problems of THEIR environment when it comes to growing and caring for a plant. If they don&#8217;t they can&#8217;t care. If they can&#8217;t care, they lose interest and give up. I think I describe everyone&#8217;s experience of buying a potted herb from a supermarket only to find it dead 2 days later.</p><p>&#8220;And I give it sun, and water but nothing. It died. I actually kept [the bonsai tree]. Maybe because I still want to know why&#8230;&#8221;</p></article><article class=timeline><p>An update from the shop floor. I&#8217;m heavily back into making the final prototype in preparation for testing over the weekend so this will just be a quick one. Note the action shot!</p></article><article class=final><ul><li class="col col12"><img src=http://placehold.it/710x600 alt=""></li><li class="col col6"><img src=http://placehold.it/420x360 alt=""></li></ul><h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
