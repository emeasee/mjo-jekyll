Lots has happened the last month on the AJOTO main site development. Notably the team have worked closely to flesh out the main interaction across multiple platforms and devices. Of course many factors come into play here and there are always questions about how the brand needs to be perceived at all these various touch points through out the day of an AJOTO customer.

*Of course many factors come into play here and there are always questions about how the brand needs to be perceived at all these various touch points through out the day of an AJOTO customer.*

Specifically this week we have been looking at mobile dimensions. 

Our specific approach is taking the form of looking first at the core navigation, which from the images below may be obviously focused on the navigation bar at the bottom of the page. Taking this a focal point we wanted to quickly explore how this simple decision to place the core navigation on the bottom of the page would translate to multiple screen sizes and how, in turn, that would suit the particular contexts in which those devices would be use. How do we want to communicate a consistent brand message across those devices? How can AJOTO be instantly recognisable on a interaction design level?

Bigger questions a-foot I think
