*Update from the second day of Experience Prototyping at the Airport.*

&#8220;Another interesting day of testing and co-creating with passengers. This time we had a lot more input from the staff at the airport about how the service/system could benefit them also. Currently the staff use an ID badge which they use to identify themselves to security and also to shops inside the airport which offer discounts on food and drink. They really saw the benefit in having a system where they could buy food using the card and then get billed from their pay. More focused on the convenience of it rather than anything else.

We increased the fidelity this time marginally, giving a bit of a digital edge to the scanning device. Also we included a journey map on the ticket. The ticket itself was redesigned to be more true to the current design in an attempt to ground a bit of reality/believability. Many passengers liked this but some commented that they confused it with their own boarding passes!

Again the information output was too slow but this time the scrolling message lent itself to be more of a &#8216;glance-able&#8217; object that passengers noted could also be read from a distance so they could leave the cashier for another customer. We also managed to test the entire system from the checkin kiosk. We set up a prototype where we gaged the reaction on people adding small amounts of change onto their boarding pass at the point of checking in. This however didn&#8217;t work so well. Passengers were stressed and didn&#8217;t appreciate it interfering when they were concentrating on getting their luggage on the flight. Convenient yes but human nature scuppered this one!&#8221;
