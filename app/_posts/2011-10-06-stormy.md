After a heavy beginning of the week in involving a lot of sense making and meetings with advisors and fellow students we all managed to organise ourselves for 2 days of intense group brainstorming. It was a fun few days with some great ideas coming out. Leading up to a break we are having in the process to do another industry project, I will be clustering and developing a rough &#8216;roadmap&#8217; for how to proceed with prototyping. Looking forward to making stuff!
