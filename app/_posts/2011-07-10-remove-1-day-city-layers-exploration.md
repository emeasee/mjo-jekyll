As part of the Systems and Layers Course here at CIID we were asked to explore the nature of an existing information output in the city and think about an intervention that would add value on a city scale for its citizens.

Our 1 day project current use of the Metro ticketing system, in which buying a single ticket entitles a full hour of travel within designated zones, and our attempt to create a way in which left over time could be fed back into the system allowing other citizens to &#8216;pick up where you left off&#8217;. 

The project was in collaboration with Martin Jensen and Yufan Wei Wang. 

Look out for another interesting exploration soon: An Urban Sensor ISO!
