Today I took a trip to the coast or Copenhagen (Amager Strand) to have a look around the allotments there. I had been tipped off about it by some friends at [CIID][1] and thought it a good opportunity to kick off some immersion and see if I could make some contacts for any future co-design/user validation.

Approaching the allotments early in the morning the place was fairly quite with not too many people around. Plots had land on which people were growing an assortment of vegetables and ornamentals as well as a small shed in which they, presumably kept tools and materials for the growing season. It was visibly obvious that it was the end of the season. Some plots were withering away while others had a bit more care put in to keep them going well into the winter season (greenhouses and such).

*Yet in general there was a wilderness about the place.* It's something I notice more and more in Denmark especially that gardeners appreciate the natural order by which their gardens/plots grow. Only exerting minimal control in ordering what grows next to what and where. As well, of course, making sure they don't invade neighbour gardens! There was also a plethora of *homemade constructions for greenhouses, trellises, potting* etc. It seems there is a joy in both growing but also facilitating that growth but constructing their own rigs and beddings rather than buying flat pack as it were.

A solitary woman managed to jump out at me from her shed and say a hello upon which I started to ask her about her garden and the more formal procedures of obtaining a space in the collective. It's been a very busy season it seams with a long waiting list for next year. And I can understand why. Almost immediately she tells me this she was showing me her rhubarb and boasting at it's size this year. *The people here are obviously proud and I'm left with the feeling, as I bid her farewell, that maybe there isn't much that should be done here to change any of that.*

Some interesting questions which I will take into my visit tomorrow with [Aarstiderne][2].
