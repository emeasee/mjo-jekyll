So we are half-way through the GUI module here at CIID and reached a milestone in development of the concept we will be developing for the next week. 

The concept is based around letter writing and how this rather beautiful analog activity can be augmented using a digital graphical user interface. We think we&#8217;ve stumbled on a great opportunity to let people focus more on the activity and less on the effort of finding and materials such as paper, envelopes, stamps etc.
