Our first phase of prototyping is complete as the end of the say sets in and passengers get less and less in the Terminal. There's only a few lonely souls now walking past me as I sit here typing this. 

Diving straight into the first few gave us the confidence we needed to start noticing some of the short comings in our prototypes. With the support of Starbucks and the Deli towards the top of the Terminal we were able to approach passengers without the worry of being hassled by the staff wondering what we were doing. The staff was very helpful and even acted along towards the end, as if it was a real service!

Some key things that came out of the first round was the fidelity and natural language of the information being displayed on the interface was pretty important and had a direct influence (more than we anticipated) on the amount of time it took a passenger to get through the payment process. Feedback from the staff at Starbucks indicated that this would pose a big problem for them, especially during peak times like in the morning. Maybe the information will need to be pushed back to become a lot more passive in nature.  
Passengers enjoyed the extra information but found it hard to understand how money was on their ticket. Some even didn't see the point since they could just use their credit card. We'll need to work on the development of the top-up system and link the two prototypes at some point so that the passenger see's the full story of the service. For now however, they liked the convenience. Confused by the real value in the system. 

More soon!
