Never in my life have I had hot glue burns and brown fingers from soil until this project!

An update from the workshop here at CIID. I&#8217;m currently putting the finishing touches on the first round of prototypes. I have an experience prototyping session arranged for Saturday morning and so I have decided to postpone my usual weeknotes until Saturday/Sunday evening to make full use of the session. (And have something more to write about other than how hard it is to laser cut Coca-Cola bottle caps&#8230; ask me about it sometime!).
