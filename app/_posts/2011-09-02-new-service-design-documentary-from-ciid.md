&#8220;As part of the Interaction Design Programme CIID ran a 4 week service design course in Collaboration with Copenhagen Airport (CPH). The idea was to envision new experiences for the different kinds of people who use the airport.

Visiting faculty from leading service design and innovation companies &#8211; Live Work and IDEO &#8211; were invited to teach the course.

This film highlights the evolution of the thinking and design processes that took place throughout the course.

Filmed and edited by Eilidh Dickson&#8221;
