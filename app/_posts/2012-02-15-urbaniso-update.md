In just under 2 days now I will be presenting the [Urban Design][1] project I did together with [Joshua Noble][2] at the [Social Cities of Tomorrow conference in Amsterdam][3]. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to meet some legends in the field of urban & interaction design and I&#8217;m really looking forward to it. 

For the occasion we have spruced up the app element of the design and made it a bit more visually friendly. Who knows maybe soon we will actually have this thing up and running and start testing it out.
