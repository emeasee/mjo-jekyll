Just a quick update to say that the Service Design course at CIID has officially drawn to close with the whole class presenting their work over the past month back to the airport. A bit congratulations to everyone involved! It went down really well!

I&#8217;ll be updating my work page soon with a more concise overview of the project but I just thought I&#8217;d share some of the work from Team CPHCloud (me, Ali Seckin Karayol and Yufan Wei Wang).

To understand a bit better [please refer to the project description in my previous post][1], it should make more sense then!

And finally our video was finished just in time to make it into the presentation. (Premiere rendering overnight turned into a gamble! Thank you experience!) 

Again thanks to everyone involved but specifically to the advisors on hand who provided invaluable advise and teaching throughout the 4 weeks of the project. In no particular order Eilidh Dickson, Brian Rink, Rory Hamilton, Are Hovland Nielson, Nina Christoffersen, Julia Frederking and Simona Maschi.

[For information about the course check out the CIID website.
