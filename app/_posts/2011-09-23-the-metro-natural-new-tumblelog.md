Just a quick note. In the process of conducting my initial desk/literary research I have set up a tumblelog to capture a bit of a visual focus for the area that I'm looking at for my thesis. 

For now it's simply, "Ongoing research into the meaning of nature in an increasingly urbanised world".

We'll see where it goes from there! Click the screengrab or over [here][1] if you prefer the classic way.
