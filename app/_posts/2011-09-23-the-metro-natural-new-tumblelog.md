Just a quick note. In the process of conducting my initial desk/literary research I have set up a tumblelog to capture a bit of a visual focus for the area that I&#8217;m looking at for my thesis. 

For now it&#8217;s simply, &#8220;Ongoing research into the meaning of nature in an increasingly urbanised world&#8221;

We&#8217;ll see where it goes from there! Click the screengrab or over [here][1] if you prefer the classic way.
