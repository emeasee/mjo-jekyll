While in Paris I was lucky enough to hold a brief co-creation session with a few people in and around Paris. The activity was simple. Make your own seeding box for use indoors. (Winter is coming in!) My initial aim was to provide as little guidance as possible and let the others build it as they want. Everyone learnt a lot, including myself. Gave me many insights and opportunities. Keep tuned for the first design prototypes.
