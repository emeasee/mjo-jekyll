A belated update indeed. Time to catch up! 

I was lucky enough to take back another batch of rapid idea prototypes to some of the people around Copenhagen I&#8217;ve been researching & co-creating with over past few weeks.

This time my concepts focused a bit more in the, if it&#8217;s fair to say, &#8220;digital realm&#8221;. The decision to tailor my prototypes more towards this was based on two things. Firstly, and unashamedly, I&#8217;ve grown an interest in developing a solution for urban gardening exploring it&#8217;s relationship with current advances in technology, sensing and social networking. It&#8217;s a like a personal inquiry. Can technology and growing something integrate better than they currently do? Secondly, a lot of the feedback I was getting from people using some of the early prototypes were highlighting inconsistencies in the way the product (or service) was conveyed through the form of an idea prototype and the reality of the solution to their everyday lives. something became clear. &#8216;Smart&#8217; stuff is everywhere now. Including that particular gem, the smartphone. 

I decided to incorporate some of these realities in an attempt to suggest ways that &#8216;smart&#8217; technology can not only be &#8216;smart&#8217; itself but also let YOU be smart. In essence that is what my project is trying to do, using growing as a context.

Here&#8217;s some examples.

<img alt="" src="/attach/IMG_8177.jpeg" class="alignleft" width="600" height="400" /> 
For now I won&#8217;t go into the exact details of how they work or what they are, suffice to say that to the right we have a service/product to help and inspire people to care for their herbs or plants by providing feedback in a specific tone of voice (I will release a video soon to explain more). To the left we have a &#8216;seed starter kit&#8217;. Simple and similar to many on the market except this one encourages you to keep in contact with your seedling through email. A strange combination I know. Strange enough for user testing? Yes! 

> &#8220;No that&#8217;s really odd I would prefer the other one where it shows me on the actual box. I feel attach then. Like it&#8217;s my box. And it&#8217;s helping me out&#8221;

An important point was bought up at this point. People, you and me and everyday folk, develop interest in something progressively and often because of incentive. It&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so common for people who eat healthy to often find themselves caring for herbs. Some even find themselves trying to sprout their own herbs at this point. But the important point raised is that it&#8217;s progressive. Pushing a seed box onto the market without a real grounding in something that encourages, excites and delights people to care for something like a plant in the first place has an obvious outcome.

A main thing I learned again from doing this testing was a dual stroke. People want help in understanding the potential and problems of THEIR environment when it comes to growing and caring for a plant. If they don&#8217;t they can&#8217;t care. If they can&#8217;t care, they lose interest and give up. I think I describe everyone&#8217;s experience of buying a potted herb from a supermarket only to find it dead 2 days later. 

&#8220;And I give it sun, and water but nothing. It died. I actually kept [the bonsai tree]. Maybe because I still want to know why&#8230;&#8221;
