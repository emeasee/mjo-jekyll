A Week in Making is a short film documenting the &#8220;goings-on&#8221; around the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design during the Physical Prototyping module taught by Massimo Banzi and David Mellis (both of Arduino fame).

The film gives a brief glimpse at some of the daily projects and people on this years Interaction Design Programme.

Thanks to Massimo Banzi, David Mellis and David Gaultier for running the 2 week workshop!

Shot and edited by me, Mac Oosthuizen.

Credit to Ergo Phizmiz & Margita Zalite for the music!
