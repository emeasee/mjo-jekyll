Just finished the prototyping plan for this week and next. Six prototypes planned in all, each one slightly different from another but all using the service I&#8217;ve mentioned before as a core. The box will (hopefully) focus the prototypes a bit and help me get them done in such a such a short space of time so as to not get stuck in trying to design the perfect box! 

As a bit of insight into my process below is a bit of scattered visualisation of my process from the research summary drawn up for brainstorming and through to my first design themes.

From my design themes I&#8217;ve laid out the six prototypes corresponding to each theme. Two prototypes for each theme exploring the concepts from the amazing brainstorming session I had here with fellow CIID&#8217;ers. Each prototype asks the questions posed by some of the concepts in a physical way so that I can get as much engagement in the experience prototyping sessions a possible.

The prototypes are:

### Smarter Service Relationship

Prototype 01a &#8211; Home delivery herbs  
*A plant box for your home that delivers information *

Activity:  
Set up a &#8216;herb-box&#8217; (like a post box) outside flat/house and over time deliver fresh herbs.

Prototype 01b &#8211; Communal/Family activity  
*A plant box for your home that encourages information sharing in a local environment (family/communal living)*

Activity:  
A fresh box of herbs with labels on what the herbs are.  
All the labels are blank and the participants need to fill in what information they would like to store there if it existed in the kitchen.

### Learning Together

Prototype 02a &#8211; Sharing knowledge  
*Encouraging remote sharing of knowledge by leveraging the services existing communication channel*

Activity:  
A delivered herb box has a book where you can write or attach notes. The activity is to think of something you would write there to someone who may receive the same box in the future.

Prototype 02b &#8211; Physical connection  
*Encouraging physical sharing of knowledge and produce in a local community area (block of flats/neighbourhood)*

Activity:  
A communal box in the hall of a block flats that has take away cards with recipes and herbs. Front is the recipe and fold out are invitation tokens to people for dinner.

### Co-creation Culture

Prototype 03a &#8211; Modularity  
*A base (herb box) that allows extension to allow urban gardening at home. Encouraging great range of freedom in creating a growing system from the herb box. *

Activity:  
A herb box comes with fold out paper &#8216;limbs&#8217; that suggest extension for extra growing space, watering system, embedded seeds, etc.  
TBC &#8211; QR codes attached to the &#8220;limbs&#8221; of the box allows you to see blueprints of extendability using everyday items around the house

Prototype 03b &#8211; Networking  
*&#8216;Making plants talk&#8217;. Physically effecting each others gardens/plants to teach & inform.*

Activity:  
A box with LEDS that indicate when the &#8216;master gardener&#8217; is caring for the plant so you can join in. (LEDS specific to watering for now). + sticker that makes it clear what it&#8217;s about and it&#8217;s not just a light.

Let&#8217;s get making!
