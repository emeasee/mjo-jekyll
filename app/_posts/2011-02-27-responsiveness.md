The responsiveness of a computer system is bound by rules and conventions. Conventions to reflect our best interests in using the computer system for semi-abstract task. But what if they could reflect our behaviour and interaction with digital media and workspace akin to a conversation between you and a friend?

That&#8217;s the key question investigated in the Mass Responsive Device. A project developed at [CIID][1] using [Processing][2] to build a &#8216;voice&#8217; for the computer. You can read more about the project at [the project page][3] on emeasee, but I thought I&#8217;d highlight a key point. This slideshow presents the full &#8216;conversation&#8217; had with my computer using my USB key filled with assets and resources from a previous project. I chose to present this to my computer in order to gage it&#8217;s reaction and so follow it&#8217;s responses&#8230;
