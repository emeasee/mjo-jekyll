Finally finished cutting together a new short video about the activities around [CIID][1]. This one from the GUI course about four months ago. Time flies indeed!

With the new video out and a bunch more footage sitting on my hard drive from other courses I've decided to start a little project. I've called it [Busy Hands][2] and I hope to make a few more short videos (sticking to around 1 minute is my only brief) highlighting the amazing work from the talented students here in the coming months.
