The Making of OnRoute is a short movie showing the process of making the animated story [OnRoute][1] which was developed in the Video Prototyping Class at [CIID][2] in response to a service design project brief. 

Me and [Alix Gillet-Kirt][3] developed an interesting technique for achieving the effect in the final film which this short flick will hopefully explain. Enjoy!
