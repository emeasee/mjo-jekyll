We have been lucky enough to have [Bill Verplank][1] teaching us for the past week or so. Its been great to talk to him although he&#8217;s one of those people that you just listen too I think!

He ran a course here at [CIID][2] called Motors & Music in which we explored haptic interfaces and music making. As you can imagine there was a great deal of excitement when it came time to make little projects to show off. [There were explorations of all kinds from a kite flying simulator to a windup music box][3]. Look out for the me and Harsha Vardhan&#8217;s project soon on the work page: [Gone Fishin&#8217;][4]!
