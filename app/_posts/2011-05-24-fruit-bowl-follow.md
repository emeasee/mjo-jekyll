As part of our idea development phase on the Tangible User Interface module at CIID it became increasingly necessary to express our concepts on a medium that could talk more about the interaction and response of the ideas we were only capturing on paper. Sketching is great but when your trying to describe the idea of a fruit bowl that follows you around your kitchen, things get a bit more tricky. 

Cue The Awesome Fruit Bowl and it&#8217;s accomplice, Water vibes!

Thanks to [Marco Triverio][1] and Hari Gopalakrishnan for the collaboration.
