The weekends efforts. I'm definitely focusing in on something more and more as I busy myself in the design phase. It's one of my favourite times of a project when working through a problem with your hands and sketching you can really start to tighten up was has been a lot of open ended questions up until now. Most are just experiments and a way for me to think. More coming soon!
