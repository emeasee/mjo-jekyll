The Industry Projects have started here at CIID. First up are CIID sponsors Velux and Novo Nordisk in which the class is split to work on either one they wish. 

I&#8217;m well underway with Velux right now and therefore it may be a bit quieter around here the coming weeks before our thesis project kicks off with the research phase. For now I&#8217;ll show what I can until word is given on how much I can actually put on the Internet. Confidentiality and all that jazz.

Back down to workshop for some more light studies!
