In this session I took an idea for a chopping board abacus which allowed you to track your diet in relation to the food pyramid. The idea was that as someone is preparing food or having a snack they can <a href=\"http://quantifiedself.com/\">self-track</a> their intake, recording it daily and be presented with a simple analog visualisation at the end of the week showing the state of their diet. This turned out to be a bit of a failure. The user validation session ended up with <strong>me</strong> doing most of the activity for them as they were way to busy chopping, mashing and frying. People just don&#8217;t have the time or inclination to add another activity during their cooking time. What struck me most was how easy it was for me as a designer to overlook (and even sometimes ignore!) these truisms in favour of an &#8216;engaging solution&#8217;. *<em>Our dreams are not always shared. *</em></p>\n\n<p>The truth is that this process of user validation, or co-creation, or whatever you call it is a really integral part of an any design process.</p>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_1969\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n  <a href=\"/attach/photo34.jpeg\"><img src=\"/attach/photo34.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"photo34\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1969\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n    An abandoned design\n  </p>\n</div>\n","excerpt":"<p>[<img src=\"/attach/photo12.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"photo12\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1968\" />][1] \nAs part of the TUI process we developed quick prototypes whose main purpose was to serve as communication tools for user validation.
