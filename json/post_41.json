A bit congratulations to everyone involved! It went down really well!</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll be updating my work page soon with a more concise overview of the project but I just thought I&#8217;d share some of the work from Team CPHCloud (me, Ali Seckin Karayol and Yufan Wei Wang).</p>\n\n<p>To understand a bit better <a href=\"/2011/08/20/sd-update-visualising-the-system/\">please refer to the project description in my previous post</a>, it should make more sense then!</p>\n\n<p>And finally our video was finished just in time to make it into the presentation. (Premiere rendering overnight turned into a gamble! Thank you experience!) </p>\n\n<p>Again thanks to everyone involved but specifically to the advisors on hand who provided invaluable advise and teaching throughout the 4 weeks of the project. In no particular order Eilidh Dickson, Brian Rink, Rory Hamilton, Are Hovland Nielson, Nina Christoffersen, Julia Frederking and Simona Maschi.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp11/courses/service-design/overview/\">For information about the course check out the CIID website.<br>\n</a></p>\n"}
