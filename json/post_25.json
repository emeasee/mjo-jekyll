As you can imagine there was a great deal of excitement when it came time to make little projects to show off. <a href=\"http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp11/courses/motors-music/projects/\">There were explorations of all kinds from a kite flying simulator to a windup music box</a>. Look out for the me and Harsha Vardhan&#8217;s project soon on the work page: <a href=\"http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp11/courses/motors-music/projects/gone-fishin/\">Gone Fishin&#8217;</a>!</p>\n"}
