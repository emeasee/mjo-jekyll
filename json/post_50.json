It&#8217;s not deep by any means but I feel it is a good enough point to start exploring with prototypes proceeding week four (I&#8217;m currently finalising plans for prototyping in Paris!). </p>\n\n<p>My main focus for this project, as is explained below in the diagram, is to first create a service of convenience and then on the back of that foundation attempt to develop a project which starts to push towards the second circle to the left and ultimately answering the question mark in the middle. It&#8217;s funny to think of my project as a question mark after all these last few weeks research and investigation but I really believe that question mark has such great value and opportunity embedded in it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/attach/proposal-01.jpeg\" alt=\"Proposal 01\" title=\"proposal-01.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"423\" /> \n<span style='text-decoration:underline;'>So what, exactly, is my design challenge?<br /> </span></p>\n\n<p>To create a product-service that helps busy, urban citizens who have the desire to eat healthily, get started with landless gardening in their own flats/apartments. This would exist within the context of, first, a convenient subscription service delivering fresh, still-growing herbs to the customersâ€™ door. Then using this channel of communication between consumer and service I want to explore how, consequently, I can help consumers maintain a garden themselves by progressively connecting them to the right knowledge about how to care for it and eventually to other gardeners/customers for inspiration and support.</p>\n\n<p>My ultimate goal would be to provide a product/service intervention that would be progressive, convenient and modular and would exist as platform upon which customers can help and inform each other, co-create new products themselves and help to promote a sustainable way of living.</p>\n\n<p><span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Why?<br /> </span></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> \n<em>The popularity of such services as Aarstiderne in Denmark and others worldwide have shown a opportunity to inspire people to eat healthily by providing a convenient service which takes a lot of the effort out of doing so. However, inspiring people to grow something themselves still remains an area of opportunity.</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>How can I create a smarter relationship between individual customers and the service by encouraging them to learn how to grow their own through knowledge exchange and experimentation?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> \n<em>Providing a system that starts small and allows the consumer to scale up in a convenient way to the point where growing something feels comfortable and even enjoyable.</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>How can I create a scalable system for apartment gardening by making it convenient and informative?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> \n<em>Waiting lists have become the bane of any beginner gardener in the city. Allotments and urban gardening initiatives are struggling to keep up with demand. A clear indicator that people want to get involved in gardening and all for different reasons.</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>How can I include those who already garden into the service to encourage people in the city to explore growing in their own homes?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> \n<em>To respond to increasing urban population and urban density.</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>How can I leverage increased population density to inspire sharing of knowledge and produce by opening channels of communications between customers?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> \n<em>Increase social engagement between neighbours, communities, the service and other customers/gardeners.</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>How can I create a user group culture to inspire customers to learn and create together by simply delivering a system with increasing potential the more involved a customer gets?</p>\n"}
