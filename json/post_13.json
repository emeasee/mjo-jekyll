Conventions to reflect our best interests in using the computer system for semi-abstract task. But what if they could reflect our behaviour and interaction with digital media and workspace akin to a conversation between you and a friend?</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the key question investigated in the Mass Responsive Device. A project developed at <a href=\"http://www.ciid.dk\">CIID</a> using <a href=\"http://processing.org\">Processing</a> to build a &#8216;voice&#8217; for the computer. You can read more about the project at <a href=\"/2011/03/03/msd/\">the project page</a> on emeasee, but I thought I&#8217;d highlight a key point. This slideshow presents the full &#8216;conversation&#8217; had with my computer using my USB key filled with assets and resources from a previous project. I chose to present this to my computer in order to gage it&#8217;s reaction and so follow it&#8217;s responses&#8230;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/attach/0 1.jpg\" class=\"alignright\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n"}
