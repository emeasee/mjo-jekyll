It&#8217;s a great opportunity to meet some legends in the field of urban &amp; interaction design and I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.</p>\n\n<p>For the occasion we have spruced up the app element of the design and made it a bit more visually friendly. Who knows maybe soon we will actually have this thing up and running and start testing it out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/portfolio/urban-sensor-iso/\" title=\"Urban Sensor ISO\">Check out the project page.</a></p>\n"}
